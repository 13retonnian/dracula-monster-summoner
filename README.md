## Problems I ran into:
I couldn't find anything that works with date in the json
I found out later that the D&D API didn't have any images so I added the hell hound summoning (it's pretty funny)
I only did one fetch at first but when you only enter the monster's number it only gives the name and url so I used the url to fetch again
